# TCP Server

This TCP Server is particularly for [TCP Client v3](https://github.com/ParaeagleRyanC/ComputerNetworks-TcpClientV3/). Minor modifications can be made to accommodate [TCP Client v1](https://github.com/ParaeagleRyanC/ComputerNetworks-TcpClientV1/) and [TCP Client v2](https://github.com/ParaeagleRyanC/ComputerNetworks-TcpClientV2/). 

As mentioned in the **clients** above, clients send requests in a certain format to the server. As the server receives the requests, it parses them, transforms the message, and sends back responses in the order received. Error handling is in place to verify all incoming requests are valid.

This program demonstrates the knowledge of building a server and familiarity with `Python` network programming.
